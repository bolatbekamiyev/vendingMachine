## What is the Vending machine ?
This is a device for selling drinks and snacks. And it accepts cash, up to and including $100.

## What does the program do?

The program shows the available products and the price. After selecting the desired product, 
the program requests the desired price for purchase. The buyer needs to deposit the required 
amount of money up to $ 100 inclusive. As soon as the buyer deposits the required amount, 
the program counts the change and gives the amount of change. As soon as the product is sold, 
the product is deleted from the database. The sale history will be recorded with a timestamp and price, 
you can then upload it to an excel file. The program has two levels of access for the buyer and 
for the administrator. The administrator can check the availability of products, add, change information, 
and delete. The administrator can view the sale history in the program or upload it to an excel file. 
He has access to how much money is in the balance of the system. 
Each stage of the program works cyclically until certain actions that are specified in the program occur. 
The program itself runs endlessly.
